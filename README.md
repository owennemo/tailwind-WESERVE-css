# tailwind-WESERVE-css
(UNCOMPLETED)

Hi, everyone.

In this Repository I learned website slicing using TailwindCSS which was obtained through a tutorial from one of the programming learning platforms, namely BuildWithAngga (https://buildwithangga.com/). Here are some things I learned in this project & tutorial:
1. Download and use free source UI/UX design from the SHAYNAKIT (https://shaynakit.com/landing)
2. Importing UI/UX into Figma and using it as a reference for slicing
3. Learn to use classes in TailwindCSS without CSS files for slicing designs into website displays
4. Slicing from UI/UX into Responsive Web Design
5. Improvisation in Responsive Slicing
